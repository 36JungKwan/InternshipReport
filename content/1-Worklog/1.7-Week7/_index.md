### OBJECTIVES IN WEEK 7:
- Finalize and optimize the Solution Architecture based on Mentor's feedback.
- Master In-memory Caching services with Amazon ElastiCache (Redis): Cluster creation, CLI/SDK connection, and data manipulation.
- Complete and submit the final project Proposal to GitHub.
- Practice Advanced Networking: Transit Gateway, Site-to-Site VPN (with Cisco CSR), ECMP Routing, and Hybrid DNS with Route 53.
