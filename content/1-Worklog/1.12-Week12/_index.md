### OBJECTIVES IN WEEK 12:
- Migrate the RAG system from development to AWS infrastructure using native services (RDS PostgreSQL + pgvector, Amazon Bedrock).
- Apply Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform to deploy RAG infrastructure automatically and consistently.
- Master Cost and Governance skills through advanced IAM Policies (Region limits, Instance Type limits).
- Setup comprehensive monitoring: Network layer (VPC Flow Logs), Application layer (Grafana), and AWS Service layer (CloudWatch).

### ACHIEVEMENTS IN WEEK 12:
1. Successfully migrated the RAG system to AWS, utilizing RDS PostgreSQL (pgvector) as the Vector Database and Amazon Bedrock (Claude Models) as the LLM.
2. Automated RAG Backend infrastructure deployment using Terraform, ensuring consistency and scalability.
3. Established strict IAM policies to control resource creation, prevent budget overruns (Cost Control), and ensure security.
4. Built a multi-layer monitoring system: Tracking network traffic with VPC Flow Logs and visualizing Application Metrics on Grafana/CloudWatch Dashboards.
