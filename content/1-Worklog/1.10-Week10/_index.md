### OBJECTIVES IN WEEK 10:
- Research and design the Backend architecture supporting Hybrid Search (combining keyword and semantic search) for the project.
- Master comprehensive Serverless architecture: From event processing (S3 triggers), storage (DynamoDB) to API building (API Gateway).
- Build an automated CI/CD pipeline for Serverless applications using AWS CodePipeline.
- Practice in-depth Serverless application Monitoring and Tracing with CloudWatch and X-Ray.

### ACHIEVEMENTS IN WEEK 10:
1. Successfully designed and tested the Hybrid Search Engine architecture, leveraging both traditional keyword search and vector (Semantic) search.
2. Built a complete Serverless Backend workflow: Automated image processing with S3 Triggers and NoSQL data management with DynamoDB.
3. Successfully deployed a Full-stack Serverless App: Connected Frontend to Backend via API Gateway and Lambda, effectively handling CORS issues.
4. Established an automated DevOps process (CI/CD) for Serverless applications, enabling rapid and error-free deployment of Code and Frontend.
5. Enhanced system operational capability by setting up Monitoring Dashboards (CloudWatch) and Request Tracing (X-Ray) for effective debugging.
