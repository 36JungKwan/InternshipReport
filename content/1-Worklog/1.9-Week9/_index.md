### ACHIEVEMENTS IN WEEK 9:
1. Successfully set up CDK working environments (Cloud9, VSCode) and deployed basic infrastructure templates.
2. Applied CDK to build advanced resources: ECS Cluster, Application Load Balancer, API Gateway, and Nested Stack structures.
3. Successfully deployed a standard Three-Tier Architecture (Web, App, Database layers) entirely via Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
4. Achieved key team project milestones: Finalized Database design, Figma UI, and completed the required dataset.
