During my internship, I participated in six AWS-related events and workshops. They helped me strengthen both my cloud fundamentals and my understanding of more advanced topics like AI/ML, security, data, and DevOps.

### [Event 1 – AWS Cloud Day Vietnam](4.1-Event1/)

&emsp;**Event Name:** AWS Cloud Day Vietnam  
&emsp;**Role:** Attendee  
&emsp;**Format:** Multi-track conference  

&emsp;**Content:** Cloud Day Vietnam was a full-day AWS event featuring keynotes and breakout sessions on cloud fundamentals, architecture best practices, AI/ML, data analytics, and modernization on AWS. I attended sessions about building cloud-native applications, security and governance in multi-account environments, and customer success stories from local companies adopting AWS.  
&emsp;**Outcomes:** The event helped me see how AWS is applied in real businesses in Vietnam, and gave me a broader view of career paths and ecosystems around cloud and AI.

### [Event 2 – Reimagine Software Development with AI](4.2-Event2/)

&emsp;**Event Name:** Reimagine Software Development with AI  
&emsp;**Role:** Attendee  
&emsp;**Format:** Technical talk  

&emsp;**Content:** The event focused on how generative AI is changing the software development lifecycle. It covered use cases such as AI-assisted code generation, test generation, documentation, code review, and troubleshooting, as well as architectural patterns for integrating AI into development workflows. The speakers also shared best practices for prompt engineering and for safely adopting AI tools in teams.  
&emsp;**Outcomes:** I learned how AI can accelerate development productivity and how to think about integrating AI assistants into my own coding and documentation workflow.

### [Event 3 – Workshop: Data Science on AWS](4.3-Event3/)

&emsp;**Event Name:** Workshop – Data Science on AWS  
&emsp;**Role:** Attendee  
&emsp;**Format:** Hands-on workshop  

&emsp;**Content:** This workshop introduced the typical data science workflow on AWS, from data ingestion and storage to analytics and model training. The speakers walked through services like Amazon S3, AWS Glue, Amazon Athena, and Amazon Redshift for data engineering, and demonstrated how to use Amazon SageMaker for model development, training, and deployment.  
&emsp;**Outcomes:** I better understood how end-to-end data pipelines are built on AWS and how data scientists can iterate quickly using managed services instead of managing their own infrastructure.

### [Event 4 – AIML & Generative AI on AWS (AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1)](4.4-Event4/)

&emsp;**Event Name:** AIML & Generative AI on AWS – AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1  
&emsp;**Role:** Attendee  
&emsp;**Format:** On-site technical session  

&emsp;**Content:** The event provided an overview of machine learning and deep learning (supervised learning tasks), then introduced foundation models and generative AI, prompt engineering (good vs bad prompts, zero-shot and few-shot prompting), chain-of-thought reasoning, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with embeddings and Amazon Titan embeddings. The second part walked through AWS AI/ML services such as Amazon Rekognition, Translate, Textract, Transcribe, Polly, Comprehend, Kendra, and Personalize, and finally covered Amazon Bedrock AgentCore concepts like runtime, memory, identity, gateway, tools, and observability.  
&emsp;**Outcomes:** I gained a structured mental model of the modern GenAI stack on AWS, understood how RAG pipelines are built end to end, and learned which managed services to combine when designing AI-powered applications.

### [Event 5 – DevOps on AWS (AWS Cloud Mastery Series #2)](4.5-Event5/)

&emsp;**Event Name:** DevOps on AWS – AWS Cloud Mastery Series #2  
&emsp;**Role:** Attendee  
&emsp;**Format:** On-site technical session  

&emsp;**Content:** This session introduced DevOps principles and showed how to implement them using AWS services. Topics included infrastructure as code (CloudFormation/Terraform), CI/CD pipelines with AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild, deployment strategies for containers and serverless applications, and monitoring/observability using CloudWatch and related tools.  
&emsp;**Outcomes:** I learned how DevOps practices and AWS tooling fit together to automate the software delivery lifecycle, which reinforced what I had learned in other workshops about building and operating applications on AWS.

### [Event 6 – AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar Workshop](4.6-Event6/)

&emsp;**Event Name:** AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar  
&emsp;**Role:** Attendee  
&emsp;**Format:** On-site workshop  

&emsp;**Content:** The session focused on the Security pillar of the AWS Well-Architected Framework. It covered identity and access management (IAM basics, least privilege, MFA, SCPs, permission boundaries, credential rotation), detection and continuous monitoring with CloudTrail, GuardDuty, and Security Hub, then moved to network and workload security using security groups, NACLs, AWS Network Firewall, Route 53 DNS Firewall, and VPC flow logs. The final part introduced data protection with AWS KMS, Secrets Manager, encryption in transit/at rest, and an overview of incident response best practices in the cloud.  
&emsp;**Outcomes:** I learned how layered security on AWS works in practice and how to combine IAM, logging, network controls, and encryption to build more secure workloads.
