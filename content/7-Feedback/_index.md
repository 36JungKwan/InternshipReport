> Here, you can freely share your personal opinions about your experience participating in the First Cloud Journey program. This will help the FCJ team improve any shortcomings based on the following aspects:

### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment at AWS FCJ is very friendly, open, and supportive. The team members are always willing to help whenever I encounter difficulties, even outside working hours. The collaborative atmosphere made it easy for me, as an extroverted person, to communicate and engage with colleagues. The workspace is well-organized and comfortable, which helped me focus better on learning and completing tasks. The environment truly felt like a learning community where everyone supports each other's growth.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
The mentors at FCJ provided excellent guidance throughout my internship. They explained concepts clearly when I didn't understand, especially in areas where I had limited experience like cloud infrastructure and software development. They always encouraged me to ask questions and were patient in helping me learn. The admin team efficiently handled administrative tasks, provided necessary documents, and created favorable conditions for me to work effectively. I particularly appreciated that the mentors allowed me to explore and solve problems independently while being available for guidance when needed.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
The MapVibe project was an excellent fit for my background. While I have a strong foundation in AI/ML and data science, the project allowed me to apply this knowledge in a real-world context while also introducing me to completely new areas like cloud computing, DevOps, and full-stack software development. This combination helped me both strengthen my existing knowledge and gain valuable practical skills in areas I had never explored before.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
This internship was an outstanding learning opportunity. I gained hands-on experience with AWS services (Lambda, RDS, API Gateway, CloudFront, Cognito, Bedrock), learned DevOps practices with Terraform, and developed software development skills working on a real project. The opportunity to work on infrastructure as code, understand cloud architecture patterns, and learn about enterprise-level development practices was invaluable. The mentors shared real-world experiences and best practices that helped me better understand the industry and plan my career path.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The culture at AWS FCJ is very positive and inclusive. Everyone respects each other, works seriously but maintains a friendly atmosphere. As someone who enjoys communication and teamwork, I felt welcomed and valued as part of the team, even as an intern. When there were challenging tasks or urgent deadlines, everyone worked together and supported one another regardless of their position. This collaborative spirit made the learning experience much more enjoyable and effective.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
The internship program provides good support including an allowance and flexible working arrangements when needed. The opportunity to participate in internal training sessions, workshops, and technical discussions was a significant benefit that enhanced my learning experience.

### Additional Questions

**What did you find most satisfying during your internship?**  
The most satisfying aspect was the opportunity to work on a real, meaningful project (MapVibe) from start to finish. Being able to see how all the pieces fit together - from infrastructure setup to application development to deployment - was incredibly rewarding. Additionally, the supportive learning environment where I could ask questions freely and learn from experienced professionals made the experience very fulfilling.

**What do you think the company should improve for future interns?**  
The program is already excellent, but I think it could be enhanced with more structured learning paths for interns with different backgrounds. For example, interns coming from AI/ML backgrounds (like myself) might benefit from more introductory sessions on cloud computing and software development fundamentals before diving into complex projects. Additionally, more peer learning sessions or intern networking opportunities could be valuable.

**If recommending to a friend, would you suggest they intern here? Why or why not?**  
Absolutely, I would highly recommend this internship program to friends. It's an excellent opportunity to learn cutting-edge technologies, work on real projects, and gain exposure to enterprise-level practices. The supportive environment, experienced mentors, and hands-on learning approach make it ideal for anyone looking to grow their skills in cloud computing, DevOps, or software development. The program is particularly valuable for students who want to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and industry practice.

### Suggestions & Expectations

**Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience?**  
- Consider providing more structured onboarding sessions covering AWS fundamentals for interns with limited cloud experience
- Organize more technical workshops or hands-on labs on specific topics (e.g., Terraform, Lambda functions, API Gateway)
- Create opportunities for interns to present their work or share learnings with the team
- Consider pairing interns with different skill levels for peer learning

**Would you like to continue this program in the future?**  
Yes, I would be very interested in continuing with the program if the opportunity arises. The learning experience has been excellent, and I believe there's still much more to learn, especially as I continue to develop my cloud and software development skills.

**Any other comments (free sharing):**  
This internship at AWS FCJ has been a transformative experience for me. Coming in with a strong background in AI/ML but limited experience in cloud and software development, I was able to significantly expand my skill set and gain confidence in new areas. The opportunity to work on the MapVibe project, learn from experienced mentors, and experience a professional working environment has been invaluable. I'm grateful for the supportive culture, the learning opportunities, and the chance to contribute to a real project. This experience has not only enhanced my technical skills but also helped me understand how to work effectively in a team and communicate professionally in a corporate setting. I would encourage any student interested in cloud computing, DevOps, or software development to apply for this program.
